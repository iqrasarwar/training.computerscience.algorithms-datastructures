<summary>Prerequisites</summary>

- **Proof by Induction**
    - It allows to prove a statement about an arbitrary number n by:
        - 1st proving it's true when n is 1 and then 
        - assuming it's true for n = k and showing it's true for n = k + 1
    - [For more details](http://comet.lehman.cuny.edu/sormani/teaching/induction.html)
- **Proofs  by contradiction**
    - It allow to prove a proposition is valid (true) by showing that assuming the proposition to be false leads to a contradiction
    - [For more details](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_contradiction)
- **T(n)** is the number of lines of code executed by an algorithm

<summary>Test Cases</summary>

- When dealing with string: special characters, encoding (ASCII, UTF-8, UTF-16)?
- When dealing with numbers:
    - Think about number size: Int. Long, ... ?
    - If there is any division: division by 0; Precision?

<summary>Big O vs. Big-Ω vs. Big-Θ</summary>

- **Big-Ω** (Omega):
    - It's a lower bound of a function
    - A function f(n) = Ω(g(n)), if there're positive constants C and k, such that 0 ≤ C g(n) ≤ f(n) for all n ≥ k
    - E.g., f(n) = n^2 + n = Ω(n) because n ≤ f(n) for n ≥ 1
    - ![Example](https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/Images/omegaGraph.gif)
    - It's NOT used in the industry
- **Big-O**:
    - It's an upper bound of a function
    - A function f(n) = O(g(n)), if there're positive constants C and k, such that 0 ≤ f(n) ≤ C g(n) for all n ≥ k
    - E.g., f(n) = n^2 = O(n^3) because f(n) ≤ n^3 for k ≥ 1
    - ![Example](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Big-O-notation.png)
    - It's used in the Industry with a different definition (see below, Big-Theta)
- **Big-Θ** (Theta):
    - A function f grows at same rate as a function g
    - If f = Ω(g) and f = O(g)
    - E.g., f(n) = n^2 + n = Θ(n^2) because n^2 ≤ f(n) ≤ n^2 for k ≥ 1
    - It's used in the industry as Big-O
- **Small-o**:
    - A function f is o(g) if f(n)/g(n) → 0 as n → ∞
    - f grows slower than g
    - It's NOT used in the industry

<details>
<summary>Time Complexity</summary>

- It describes the rate of increase of an algorithm
- It describes how an algorithm scales when input grows
- Big-O notation is used
- It's also called **Asymptotic runtime**:
    - It's only asymptotic
    - It tells us about what happens when we put really big inputs into the algorithm
    - It doesn't tell us anything about how long it takes
    - Its hidden constants:
        - They're usually moderately small, and therefore, we have something useful
        - They're could be big
    - Sometimes an algorithm A with worse Big-O runtime than algorithm B:
        - Algorithm A is worse asymptotically on very large inputs than algorithm B does
        - But algorithm A is better for all practical sizes and very large inputs couldn't be stored 
- E.g., O(1), O(n), O(n^2) , O(Log n), O(n log n), O(2^n)
- [Data structure and theirs related algorithms time complexity](https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/)

<details>
<summary>Space Complexity</summary>

- It describes the amount of memory - or space - required for an algorithm
- It useful to compare the performance of algorithms
    - Input size from which an algorithm will experience unsufficient memory (RAM) and start using Disk lookups
- Big O notation and concept are used

<details>
<summary>Big-O Rules</summary>

- **Drop the constants**: we'll use O(n) instead of O(2 n)
- **Drop the Non-Dominant Terms**: we'll use O(n^2) instead of O(n^2 + n) or O(n) instead of O(n + log n) 
- Multi-Part Algorithms - Add: **O(A+B)**
    - When an algorithm  is in the form 
    - Do A, 
    - When you're done, Do B
- Multi-Part Algorithms - Multiply: **O(A*B)**
    - When an algorithm is in the form: 
    - Do B for each time you do A
- **Amortized Time**
    - When the worst case happens once a while 
    - But once it happens, it won't happen again for so long that the cost is "amortized" 
    - E.g., insert in a dynamic resizing array (an array list): 
        - It's implemented with an array 
        - When the array hits its capacity, it will create a new array with double the capacity and copy all the elements over to the new array
        - Insert time complexity in expected case (the array isn't full): O(1)
        - Insert time complexity in worst case (the array is full): O(n)
        - Insert time complexity for n inserts: O(n) (for n expected cases) + O(w * n) (w worst cases): O((w+1)n) = O(n)
        - The amortization time for each insertion (the time complexity for n inserts divided by n): O(1)
- **Log n** runtimes: O(log n)
    - It when the number of elements in a problem space is halved each time (or divided by n) 
    - E.g. **Dichotomic search**: search in a sorted array
- The base of Log(n) isn't import
    - E.g. O(Log2 n) = O(Log3 n) = O(Log n) 
- **Recursive Runtimes**, a recursive algorithm usually is defined by:
    - Its **depth**: n and the **number of times each recursive call branches** (itself). 
    - **Time complexity: O(branchesNbr^n)** 
    - **Space complexity: O(n)**
    - E.g., Fibonacci Recursive time complexity: O(2^n)
    - E.g., Fibonacci Space complexity: O(n): because only O(N) nodes exist at any given time 
- The **base of an Exponent**:
    - Log(8^n) is completely different than Log(2^n)

<summary>General Approaches</summary>

- **Tournament** approach:
    - To find the kth largest number in an array, compare each paire of 2 elements together
    - compare(elem 0, elem 1), compare(elem 2, elem 3)...
    - O(n + log(n) − 2)
- **Euclidean** Algorithm

<summary>Greedy Algorithms</summary>

- **Greedy Strategy**:
    - **1. Make a greedy choice**
    - **2. Prove that it is a safe choice**
    - **3. Reduce to a subproblem**
    - **4. Solve the subproblem (Iterate)**
    - E.g. Problem, Queue of Patients:
        - n patients have come to the doctor’s office at same time
        - Ti is the time needed for treatment of the i-th patient
        - They can be treated in any order 
        - Output: Arrange the patients in such a queue that the total waiting time is minimized
    - E.g. Solution:
        - Make a greedy choice: choose the patient (Pi) with the smallest treatment time (with the minimum Ti)
        - Prove that it's a safe choice
        - Reduce to a smaller problem: remove Pi from the queue
        - Iterate: Treat all the remaining patients in such order as to minimize their total waiting time as if there wasn't 1st patient
- **Subproblem** 
    - It's a similar problem of smaller size
    - Minimum total waiting time for n patients = (n − 1) · T min + minimum total waiting time for n − 1 patients without T min
    - Min total waiting time for n = 4 partients: (15, 10, 25, 20) = (4 - 1) * 10 + Min total waiting time for (15, 25, 20)
- **Safe Choice**:
    - It's a greedy choice which there's an optimal solution consistent with this 1st choice
    - It requires to **prove** that a greedy choice is safe
    - E.g. Queue of Patients: 
        - If we prove that there's an optimal solution that starts with treating a patient with the minimum treatment time
        - Therefore such a choice is a safe choice
        - However, if we choose a patient with the maximum treatment time, there's not an optimal solution that starts with it
        - Therefore such a choice isn't a safe choice

<summary>Divide and Conquer</summary>

- **Divide**: Break into non-overlapping subproblems of the same type
- **Conquer**:
    - Solve subproblems: each one indepently of the others
    - Combine results
- Implementation: it's often implemented with a **recursive** algorithm
- Calculate its Time Complexity:
    - Define a corresponding **recurrence relation**, **T**
        - It's an equation recursively defining a sequence of values
        - For Linear Search *T(n) = T(n - 1) + c*; *T(0) = c*
        - *c* is the runtime for a constant amount of work: checking high vs. low indexes; if A[low] == key); preparing the parameters for the recursive call
        - *T(0)* is the runtime for the **base case** of the recursion (empty array): checking high vs. low indexes, returning not found
        - For Binary Search *T(n) = T(n/2) + c*; *T(0) = c*
    - Determine **worst-case runtime**, T(n) from the recurrence relation
        - Look at the **recursion tree**
        - For Linear Search T(n) = T(n - 1) + c = T(n - 2) + 2 * c = n * c = T(n) = Θ(n)
        - For Binary Search T(n) = T(n/2) + c = T(n/2^2) + 2 * c = T(n/2^3) + 3 * c = Θ(log2 n) = Θ(log n)
- Optionally, create iterative solution
    - It allows to save space

    - **Quick Sort**
        - It's more efficient in practice than Merge Sort
        - Average Time Complexity: O(n log n)
        - Time Complexity in the worst case: O(n^2)

        - [Quick Sort wth deterministic pivot selection heuristic]:
            - The pivot could be the median of the 1st, middle, and last element
            - If the recursion depth exceeds a certain threshold ***c log n***, the algorithm switches to heap sort
            - It's a simple but heuristic approach:: it's not guaranteed to be optimal
            - The time complexity is: O(n log n) in the worst case

<summary>Dynamic Programming</summary>

- It's mainly an optimization over plain recursion.
- It's an alternative for Recursive algorithms:
    - Recursive algorithms may be not efficient: they could do a compute several times
    - E.g. Money change problem MinCoin(40 cents) in Tanzania:
        - MinCoin(40s) = 1 + Min( MinCoin(40c - 1c), MinCoin(40c - 5c), MinCoin(40c - 10c), MinCoin(40c - 20c), MinCoin(40c - 25c))
        - MinCoin(20c) is computed at least 4 times: MinCoin(40c - 1c), MinCoin(40c - 5c), MinCoin(40c - 10c), MinCoin(40c - 20c)
- It's an alternative for Greedy Algorithms: 
    - When there is not a safe choice
    - E.g.1, Money change problem MinCoin(40 cents) in US:
        - US coins <= 40c: 1c, 5c, 10c, 25c
        - A Greedy choice: take the max coin such that coin <= 40c
        - Result: 3 coins: 40c = 1 * 25c + 1 * 10c + 1 * 5c
        - Here this choice is safe
    - E.g.2, Money change problem MinCoin(40 cents) in Tanzania:
        - Tanzanian coins <= 40c: 1c, 5c, 10c, 20c, 25c
        - A greedy choice: take the max coin such that the coin <= 40c
        - Result: 3 coins: 40c = 1 * 25c + 1 * 10c + 1 * 5c
        - Here this choice isn't safe: 40c = 2 * 20c
